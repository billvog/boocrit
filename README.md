# Boocrit: the online book community.

## What is Boocrit?
Boocrit is an online community, that people around the world can have conversations about books or even review them.

In short; it’s the place for the books lovers.

## Why you should use it?
Boocrit doesn’t depend on any physical library, so you can find ANY book that has an ISBN and is registered on Google Books and read reviews about it. You won’t have to worry about our library not being up to date.

Moreover, we’re not trying to persuade you to buy a book, since we aren’t selling. So, the honesty in the reviews is another reason why you should use Boocrit.
